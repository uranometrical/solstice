Comprehensive mappings for Moonsworth/Lunar Client software.

This is a monolithic repository that hosts various mappings for Lunar Client-related software, including `vpatcher-prod` and (eventually) various Lunar Client versions.

As opposed to the branch-based organization used in other version-dependent mapping projects such as [FabricMC/yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn), organization is managed using subdirectories. These subdirectories house different projects, which are further divided by version if needed.

Later on, additional projects are likely to be stored here (as well as in [uranometrical/maria](https://github.com/uranometrical/maria)), which will be designed to aid in mapping creation, application, and updating across versions.

<!-- ~~See the proposal [here](https://tomat.dev/projects/uranometrical-notes/automatic-lunar-deobf).~~ -->

For generic information on different Lunar Client programs, there are markdown files written in `./mappings/`. Later on, this information will be rewritten and moved to [uranometrical/notes](https://github.com/uranometrical/notes).
