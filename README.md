Lunar Client mappings - done right.

This is a monolithic repository that will house the mappings of various Lunar Client-related projects, such as `vpatcher`, the OptiFine distribution of numerous versions, etc.

As opposed to the branch-based organization used in projects like [yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn), organization is done through sub-directories, further divided up by Lunar Client commit release IDs. This is done in order to keep pipelines and other miscellaneous things updated if they were to be introduced, as well as other projects housed here that will aid in map creation and reverse-engineering.

~~See the proposal [here](https://tomat.dev/projects/uranometrical-notes/automatic-lunar-deobf).~~

For generic information on different Lunar Client programs, there are markdown files written in `./mappings/`. Later on, these information will be moved to [`uranometrical/notes`](https://github.com/uranometrical/notes).
