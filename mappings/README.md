# vpatcher-prod Resources
Lunar packed existing libraries into this `.jar` and obfuscated them.

If anyone would like to contribute to actual package reorganization, please feel free to.

Classes with proper packages indicate that a class is fully or mostly completely deobfuscated.

Currently known packaged libraries:
* https://github.com/lightbend/config/
* https://github.com/apache/commons-compress (Likely)
* https://github.com/google/gson (Likely)
* https://github.com/mantlik/xdeltaencoder/tree/master/src/main/java/com/nothome/delta
