Classes with proper packages indicate that a class is fully or mostly completely deobfuscated.

For smaller programs, such as `vpatcher-prod`, which have libraries included in the raw `.jar` (and, in turn, are obfuscated alongside the actual project), most third-party libraries will remain obfuscated. The current focus is for the actual relevant pieces of a project to be remapped.
