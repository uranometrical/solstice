Classes with proper packages indicate that a class is fully or mostly completely deobfuscated.

# vpatcher-prod Resources
Lunar packed existing libraries into this `.jar` and obfuscated them.

I currently have no intention of mapping classes from the various packaged libraries. If someone would like to PR these contributions, feel free - because I am not doing them myself.

Currently known packaged libraries:
* https://github.com/lightbend/config/
* https://github.com/apache/commons-compress (Likely)
* https://github.com/google/gson (Likely)
* https://github.com/mantlik/xdeltaencoder/tree/master/src/main/java/com/nothome/delta
